# Big Mouth Billy Bass & Raspberry Pi Pico W
Control a Big Mouth Billy Bass animatronic fish over wifi using a Raspberry Pi Pico W - which hosts its own a webpage!

The Raspberry Pi Pico W is a very capable Microcontroller - it can even host simple webpages, and enable you to control things over the internet by accepting commands and then acting upon them. 

I've seen a lot of projects that let you turn an LED on and off, from a webpage hosted on a Pico W, so I thought I'd take this one step further - letting you control a animatronic fish over the Internet. 

Currently there isn't a livestream of the fish, so you'll have to trust me that its working and responding to your requests.
